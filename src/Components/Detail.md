1. Design Choices:
Personal Aesthetic: I chose a modern and clean design that reflects my personal style, aiming for a professional yet approachable look. The color palette was selected to evoke a sense of trust and reliability, incorporating calming tones that resonate with healthcare themes.

Header with Call-to-Action (CTA): The landing page features a bold header that prominently displays the course title along with a clear Call-to-Action button (“Enroll Now”). This design choice emphasizes the importance of user engagement right from the start, making it easy for visitors to understand the course's purpose.

Key Features and Benefits Section: I utilized a structured layout to present the course's key features and benefits. This design choice allows for easy scanning of information, ensuring users can quickly grasp the value proposition of the course.

Visual Course Structure: A timeline or module breakdown was incorporated to visually communicate the course structure. This element not only enhances visual interest but also aids in conveying complex information in an easily digestible format.

Testimonial and FAQ Sections: The design includes dedicated sections for testimonials and FAQs. I opted for an expandable/collapsible FAQ section to maintain a clean look while still providing essential information. This layout was chosen to improve user experience by reducing clutter and allowing users to focus on relevant content.

Footer: The footer includes essential links and contact information, ensuring users have easy access to navigate the website. This was designed to enhance overall usability and maintain a seamless user experience.

2. Development Choices:
Technologies Used: The landing page was developed using Next.js for its performance benefits and Tailwind CSS for a flexible and responsive design. These technologies were selected to facilitate a high-quality user experience while allowing me to express my design preferences effectively.

Responsive Design: A mobile-first approach was adopted to ensure the landing page is fully responsive across devices. Tailwind's responsive utilities were utilized to create a design that looks great on any screen size, reflecting my commitment to user-centric design.

User Experience Focus: The user journey was carefully considered, with strategically placed CTAs to drive conversions. The design choices encourage users to explore the content further and lead them toward enrollment, showcasing my focus on maximizing user engagement.

3. Integration with CMS:
The landing page is designed to be compatible with various CMS platforms. The modular components allow for easy integration into the existing website framework, maintaining the overall aesthetic while providing flexibility for future updates.
